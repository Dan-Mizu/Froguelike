- Keyboard to Move, Mouse to Attack/Use Abilities
- Randomly Generated Dungeons

## **Storyboard**

- Start with a frog on a lilypad.
- A little fairy or something flies overhead and the frog eats it with its long ass tongue, mistaking it for a fly.
- A magical puff of smoke or something appears around the frog shortly after, and the frog has become anthropomorphic (stands on two legs) and has a wand and wizard hat.
- The frog jumps off screen.
- A new scene begins with the frog at the edge of the river, in front of where the fairy must have come from- a small mystical cave opening.

## **Languages & Tools**

- Typescript
- Phaser 3 (or 4 if thats ever out)
- Electron
- Rollup
- Vite

## **Easter Egg Ideas**

- Long ass credits. Maybe a long ass list of viewers with random fake roles. (like when he finished playing modern warfare)
